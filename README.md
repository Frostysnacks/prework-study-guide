# <My Prework Study Guide>

## Description

Hello, this is a study guide that I made as my first step into coding. This study guide provides quick notes on the 4 basic coding languages to make a basic website. I am very excited to delve deeper into the world of coding and with this basic study guide I hope it will give others a basic idea of what a project like this will look like!

This study guide contains a few notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If you open the DevTools consolse you can see the barebones Javascript running. It lists all the topis that were covered in this bootcamp prework. The Javascript code will also choose a topic to study at random using the Math. function!
